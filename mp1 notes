Linearizibility

option 1:
	- Server keeps a dictionary for each client
	- Client writes to it / reads from it through messages
	- insert <key> <value> <model>
		* client forwards whole command to Server
		* server broadcasts message and modifies dictionarys appropriately

option 2:
	- Client keeps its own dictionary
	- 

--------------------------------------?????-----------------------------------------
Q1. does every client have their own dictionary?
					OR
	Server contains the dictionaries for the clients?

Server can contain the dictionaries because delay happens from client to server
	write operation will still result in different time stamps for different clients
