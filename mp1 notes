************Message format of special operations***********

insert / update:
"insert/update <key> <value> <model> <source> <dest>"

get:
"get <key> <model> <source> <dest>"

delete:
"delete <key> <source> <dest>"

ACK from client to server:
"ACK <requested operation message> <sender> <operation requester>"

ACK from server to client
"ACK <operation message>"

********************cmd_in_progress Format*************

"command key"

Linearizibility PROBLEM:
One operation of insert is blocking future send requests

PROBLEM:
	insert happens only once and blocks future requests/operations
	FOUND BUG: 
	 	- append is not working after 1 insert finishes


Server is not forwarding inserts sometimes. sendThread issue


single insert_handler is sufficient.
Type of models become important at receipt at the client
