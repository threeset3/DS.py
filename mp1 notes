************Message format of special operations***********

insert / update:
"insert/update <key> <value> <model> <source> <dest>"
get:
"get <key> <model> <source> <dest>"
delete:
"delete <key> <source> <dest>"
ACK:
"ACK <requested operation message>"

*************
Server will receive ACKs from different operations --> need a way to differentiate the ACKs

	-- dict{"message_id" : "ACK_counter"}
Problem
	Final ACK is being sent to all the clients instead of just the requester

********************cmd_in_progress Format*************

"command key"
