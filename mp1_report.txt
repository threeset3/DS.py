1. Description of implementation of the channel delays
	We deployed a central server that acts as the communication channel between each of the nodes.
	Each node first connects to the central server and then sends messages to other nodes by
	sending the request to the central server. Central server than relays the request to destination
	node with artificial delay of random amount capped at certain values for each destination node.

2. Description of consistency models
	a. Linearizability
		Linearizability is implemented with totally ordered broadcast. Upon request for insert/update of
		a key and a value with the linearizability model, The client sends insert messages to the central
		server with varying destination nodes. The central server then relays the messages to respective
		nodes and sets up an ACK counter. Upon receiving ACK from each node, ACK counter will be incremented
		and when the counter reaches total number of nodes connected, server sends final ACK to the requester
		that the insert oepration is complete.
		For a read/get command with this model, we send the server a get request that will be broadcasted,
		and upon receivinng our own request, we return the local value.			

	b. Sequential consistency
		Insert with sequential consistency model employs exact same method as the linearizability model.
		However for the read/get command, instead of waiting for the bcast message from server, we return
		the local copy instaneously.

	c. Inconsistency repair
